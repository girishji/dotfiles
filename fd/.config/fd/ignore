#  A .fdignore or .ignore file will always just affect directories below it
# See PATTERN FORMAT in https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore

# If there is a separator at the beginning or middle (or both) of the pattern,
# then the pattern is relative to the directory level of the particular
# .gitignore file itself. Otherwise the pattern may also match at any level
# below the .gitignore level.

# If there is a separator at the end of the pattern then the pattern will only
# match directories, otherwise the pattern can match both files and
# directories.

# avoid these if they are anywhere in the path
build/

# following works only when 'fd' from above qmk_firmware dir
