------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:ts[elect][!] [name]	List the tags that match [name], using the
			information in the tags file(s).
			When [name] is not given, the last tag name from the
			tag stack is used.

g]			Like CTRL-], but use ":tselect" instead of ":tag".

{Visual}g]		Same as "g]", but use the highlighted text as the
			identifier.

:tj[ump][!] [name]	Like ":tselect", but jump to the tag directly when
			there is only one match.

g CTRL-]		Like CTRL-], but use ":tjump" instead of ":tag".

{Visual}g CTRL-]	Same as "g CTRL-]", but use the highlighted text as
			the identifier.

To search for a specific tag and open Vim to its definition, run the following command in your shell:
vim -t <tag>

Or, open any Linux source file in Vim and use the following basic commands:

Keyboard command

Ctrl-]
