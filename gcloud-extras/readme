# Just use bash. They removed zsh. It has to be installed, and then .zshrc is
not there, and 'apt-get install' does not work, etc.
# note: it takes a few minutes for zsh to appear in /etc/shells (list of valid shells)
# https://zsh.sourceforge.io/FAQ/zshfaq01.html#l7

- Install zsh
	sudo apt-get install zsh

- Change to zsh
	sudo chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh "$USER"

- ".to_install" file only works if you do the above (chsh to zsh)
  copy .to_install file to VM.
