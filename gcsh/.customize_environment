# Cloud Shell automatically runs the script, $HOME/.customize_environment, when
# your instance boots up. Unlike .profile or .bashrc, this script runs once
# when Cloud Shell boots (rather than once for each shell login).

# This script runs as root and you can install any packages that you want to
# exist in each Cloud Shell session using Debian package management commands.
